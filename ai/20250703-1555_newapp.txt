I want to create new GUI application to monitor network connection using ping.
The application uses egui like in `~/prog/mypomodoro/`.

In the form, there are 12 solid circles located in the place like a hour indigator on a clock face.
Each circle represents a 5-seconds interval, and the color of the circle changes based on the last ping result:
- Green: Ping successful (less than 100ms)
- Yellow: Ping successful but slow (between 100ms and 200ms)
- Orange: Ping very slow (between 200ms+)
- Red: Ping failed (timeout or unreachable)
- Gray: No ping data available

The application should have the following features:
1. A button to start/stop the ping monitoring.
2. A text box to enter the IP address or hostname to ping.
3. A label to display the current ping result. (mean ping time and loss rate)

First time the application is started, all circles are gray color, indicating no ping data available.
After clicking the start button, the application begins pinging the specified IP address or hostname every 5 seconds and updates the circles accordingly.
Every 5 seconds of system time (like 00:00:00 = circle at 12 o'clock, 00:00:05 = circle at 1 o'clock, 00:00:10 = circle at 2 o'clock, ...), the application pings the specified IP address or hostname and updates the corresponding circle color based on the ping result.

Please create the code for this application using Rust and egui.
